How to add links 
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>

Open link in new tab in web browser 
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>

rel="noopener noreferrer is paired with target="_blank" for security reason 

You can link files in the local directory as file numbers 

  <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

./ you are specifying to your code that it should looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory 

<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">

../ makes you go to parent directory 

<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png"> alt="The Odin Project Logo">
