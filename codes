GIT 
Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination)
